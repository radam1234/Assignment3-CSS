    <h2> Interesting Facts </h2>
    <div>
        <ul>
            <li> - Hershey became interested in chocolate after the 1893 World's Fair in Chicago.
                Inspired by German chocolate production, he opened the Hershey Chocolate Company in 1900, selling his caramel</li>

            <li> - In response to a potential threat from Beech Nut Gum, Hershey introduced "Easy Chew" gum in 1915.
                Import restrictions on sugar and chicle led to the discontinuation of Easy Chew in 1924</li>

            <li> - Hershey's KISSES debuted in 1907, but the origin of the name remains a mystery.
                One theory suggests the name might be related to the sound or motion during manufacturing</li>

            <li> - KISSES were initially wrapped by hand until wrapping machines were developed in 1921.</li>

            <li> - Hershey built the town of Hershey, Pennsylvania, for the well-being of his factory employees.
                The community included brick houses, lawns, and Hersheypark for recreational purposes</li>

            <li> - The company's logo was the "Cocoa Bean Baby" from 1898 until 1968 when it became the Hershey Food Corporation.</li>
        </ul>
